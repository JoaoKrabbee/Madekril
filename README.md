# Madekril
My first project as a web developer for a company that makes wood and acrylic decorations for shoes and bags.

I started the developer course about 3 months ago, I completed all the intermediate HTML and CSS modules, I made my first sale for a low price, but it was just to get into this world.

The project is not live yet due to the lack of some photos that the owner wants to add to the site, but there is no time to hire a photographer (photos used are for illustrative purposes only)
